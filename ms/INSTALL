This directory is for building GNU diffutils on PC operating systems.
It currently assumes GCC and emx.

To build, check `Makefile' (particularly its configuration section)
and then do the following:

	cd ..
	make -f pc/Makefile OS-TARGET

where OS is either `dos' or `os2', and TARGET is either `debug' or `release'.

If you change pc/Makefile, check your changes by running
`make -f pc/Makefile pc/Makefile.chk'.
